LAB 2: Google Cloud Fundamentals: Getting Started with App Engine
Objectives:

In this lab, you learn how to perform the following tasks:

    Initialize App Engine.

    Preview an App Engine application running locally in Cloud Shell.

    Deploy an App Engine application, so that others can reach it.

    Disable an App Engine application, when you no longer want it to be visible.

Steps:

    Initialize App Engine:

        Initialize App Engine app with a project and choose its region:

        gcloud app create --project=$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID --region=us-central

        Clone the source code repository for a sample application in the hello_world directory:

        git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/python-docs-samples

        Navigate to the source directory:

        cd python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python3/hello_world

    Run Hello World application locally:

        Download and update the packages list:

        sudo apt-get update

        Set up a python virtual environment in which the application will run:

        sudo apt-get install virtualenv -y

        virtualenv -p python3 venv

        Activate the virtual environment

        source venv/bin/activate

        Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies

        pip install -r requirements.txt

        To run the application:

        python main.py

    Deploy and run Hello World on App Engine:

        Navigate to the source directory:

        cd ~/python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python3/hello_world

        Deploy your Hello World application:

        gcloud app deploy
            If prompted enter y

        Launch your browser to view the app:

        gcloud app browse

    Disable the application:

    gcloud app versions stop 20200910t135648

    Note: Auto-scaling has to be disabled
